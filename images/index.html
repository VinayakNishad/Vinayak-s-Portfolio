        <p class="internship-description">
            I recently completed a two-month internship at <strong>CIDROY TECHNOLOGIES LLP</strong>, a software company located in Sancoale, Goa. The internship was conducted entirely remotely, allowing me to work from home effectively. 
        </p>
        <p class="internship-details">
            The HR manager, <strong>Mr. Shubham Yadav</strong>, conducted the interview with professionalism and made the onboarding process smooth. During my internship, I joined the designing team and participated in daily online meetings at 10 a.m. via Microsoft Teams. <strong>Mr. Karthik Karthikeyan</strong> guided me throughout the internship, providing constructive feedback and helping me enhance my design skills. 
        </p>
        <p class="internship-collaboration">
            I also received support from <strong>Ms. Shalaka Aher</strong>, who assisted me with updates and UI refactoring tasks. This collaboration improved my understanding of UI/UX processes and design refinement. 
        </p>
        <p class="internship-summary">
            Overall, this internship was a fantastic experience that allowed me to grow as a designer. I am incredibly grateful to the design team and CIDROY TECHNOLOGIES LLP for providing me with this valuable opportunity.
